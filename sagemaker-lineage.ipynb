    "Amazon SageMaker Lineage tracks events that happen within SageMaker allowing the relationships between them to be traced via a graph structure. SageMaker Lineage introduces a new API called LineageQuery that allows customers to query the lineage graph structure to discover relationship across their Machine Learning entities.\n",

    "Your machine learning workflows can generate deeply nested relationships, the lineage APIs allow you to answer questions about these relationships. For example find all Data Sets that trained the model deployed to a given Endpoint or find all Models trained by a Data Set.\n",

    "The lineage graph is created automatically by SageMaker and you can directly create or modify your own lineage.\n",
